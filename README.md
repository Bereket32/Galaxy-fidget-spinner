# Galaxy-fidget-spinner

A brief overview for your project that includes answers to the brainstorming questions: (1) what are your users casually creating, (2) how do you keep them engaged and excited to create, and (3) how do you help them make something they are proud to share.

My project allows you to make slinning ecliplse circles rapidly. it will change colors as well. Depending on how fast you spin or how wide your strokes are, you can create large spins or small spins. In the background there are random stars that will appear as you do this. Users have the ability to press n and freeze the picture they create. 

At least 1 paragraph that explains how the system is personally meaningful to you.

I have ADHD and most times it's easy for me to get distracted by the smallest of things. Sometimes movement or figeting something can distract me enough to focus. What I mean by this is sometimes figeting with something can allow me to focus better. This program for me is like a fidget of sorts. Something I could do to focus. I also think this could be art as well. there are some pretty pictures you can make.

At least 1 paragraph that explains how working on this system challenged you as a computer scientist. How did you push yourself outside of your comfort zone? Why was this an important challenge for you? What are the next steps for you going forward?

This system  signifies an ahviement of sorts. When I started this course my coding knowledge was rough, most of what I knew revloved around data structres and intro to comp sci while others had extensive coding backgrounds and internships for big firms. Leanring I new form of computation is still a struggle for me. They say once you've picked up multiple langagues the rrest come easier but I'm still triyng to pick up more language, but I challenged myself by not limiting the work I create and using other examples as bridges to my own.

Document bugs in your code, if any. (Ideally, you would have no bugs in your final project submission to obtain a perfect score. However, if you find that you have last-minute bugs, it is far better to document them in your README than to have your users discover them on their own.)
Credit any external sources or references.

No known bugs.

A lof of my work is based in the concepts and implementations of those concepts

These examples helped me etch out the the circles in an interactive way. From there I tried to tweak and change it to make it my own and what I wanted of it.
